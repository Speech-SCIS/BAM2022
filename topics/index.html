                <h2> AI and Legal Knowledge Building </h2>
                <p> Generally in case of judiciary, end users have to wait for a long time to get their desired
                    justice which directly affects their efficiency, contribution and well-being in this society.
                    Using the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Legal knowledge based tools may
                    accelerate the service delivery of legal professionals from typical searching of related case
                    journals to extraction of precise information in a customized manner. There is much
                    progress in the scientific field of legal artificial intelligence though. The research isn’t
                    aiming for automation, but for improved quality, knowledge and speed in the work of
                    legal professionals

                <h2> AI in Music </h2>
                <p> The contribution of artificial intelligence in music is less popular. Music is regarded as
                    one of the most human characteristics. So, what happens if it’s generated by a machine?
                    Machine learning models are used by AI to build new correlations and patterns from the
                    data it receives. There are presently millions upon millions of tracks accessible for
                    streaming in the music industry. The ability of artificial intelligence in music, to learn
                    and iterate depending on its knowledge has resulted in some significant developments.

                     </h2>
                <p> India had a glorious past with a rich and flourishing culture. In the future of India lies the future of a sixth of the world's population. As the Artificial
                    Intelligence (AI) revolution sweeps through societies and enters daily life, its role in
                    shaping India's development and growth is bound to be substantial. For India, AI holds
                    promise as a catalyst to accelerate progress, while providing mechanisms to leapfrog
                    traditional hurdles such as poor infrastructure and bureaucracy. At the same time, an
                    investment in AI is accompanied by risk factors with long-term implications on society:
                    it is imperative that risks be vetted at this early stage.<br/>
                    The digital age is transforming cultural heritage in methods of both creation and
                    preservation. Whereas once we collected objects such as books, sculptures, statues, and
                    paintings, we now also face the preservation and the archiving of digital artifacts. These
                    might be digital representations of physical objects or purely digital creations that are
                    culturally significant and worthy of preservation in their own right, such as interactive
                    works of art, blogs, or even the World Wide Web itself. Intelligent systems can be used at
                    different stages of creation, identification, preservation, authentication, and retrieval of
                    these digital assets.

                <h2> NLP and their applications </h2>
                <p> Natural Language Processing is among the hottest topic in the field of data science. Because just in a few years’ time span, natural language processing has evolved into something so powerful and impactful, which no one could have imagined. To understand the power of natural language processing and its impact on our lives, we need to take a look at its applications. Therefore, I have put together a list of some applications of natural language processing.

                <h2> Bharat ki Nyaya shastra </h2>
                <p> India has the oldest judiciary in the world.The concept of Dharma that ruled Indian civilization, from Vedic period up to Muslim invasion from King to his last servant everyone was bound by Dharma, The word Dharma is derived from "dhr" to mean to uphold, sustain or nourish.
                    Manusmriti written by the ancient sage Manu prescribes ten essential rules for the observance of Dharma.
                    Patience (dhriti), forgiveness (kshama), piety or self control (dama), honesty (asteya), sanctity (shauch),
                     control of senses (indraiya-nigrah), reason (dhi), knowledge or learning (vidya), truthfulness (satya) 
                    and absence of anger (krodha).
                    Amendment has been the most powerful part of Bharat nyaya shastra.

                <h2> Role of sanathana dharma and Sanskrit in language and NLP research  </h2>
                <p> Sanskrit is the oldest Know language to man kind that has such great grammar. Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī grammar has all the features of a modern general-purpose high-level programming language such as C++ or Python. 
                    This includes object-oriented concepts of classes, parent/child inheritance or base/derived classes, overriding of inherited methods 
                    in derived classes, concept of functions, concept of keywords, etc. Of course, algorithmic derivation of results is a given.
                    **There are nearly 14 universities in Germany(Engineering hub of the world) teaching Sanskrit.Where as there are only 18 universities in India.
