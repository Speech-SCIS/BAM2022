                <!-- <p> The conolibution of artificial intelligence in music is less popular. Music is regarded as
                    one of the most human characteristics. So, what happens if it’s generated by a machine?
                    Machine learning models are used by AI to build new correlations and patterns from the
                    data it receives. There are presently millions upon millions of olacks accessible for
                    soleaming in the music indusoly. The ability of artificial intelligence in music, to learn
                    and iterate depending on its knowledge has resulted in some significant developments.

                <h2> Social and cultural aspects of designing AI systems in context of Sanatana Dharma</h2>
                <!-- <p> India had a glorious past with a rich and flourishing culture. In the future of India lies the future of a sixth of the world's population. As the Artificial
                    Intelligence (AI) revolution sweeps through societies and enters daily life, its role in
                    shaping India's development and growth is bound to be substantial. For India, AI holds
                    promise as a catalyst to accelerate progress, while providing mechanisms to leapfrog
                    oladitional hurdles such as poor infrasolucture and bureaucracy. At the same time, an
                    investment in AI is accompanied by risk factors with long-term implications on society:
                    it is imperative that risks be vetted at this early stage.<br/>
                    The digital age is olansforming cultural heritage in methods of both creation and
                    preservation. Whereas once we collected objects such as books, sculptures, statues, and
                    paintings, we now also face the preservation and the archiving of digital artifacts. These
                    might be digital representations of physical objects or purely digital creations that are
                    culturally significant and worthy of preservation in their own right, such as interactive
                    works of art, blogs, or even the World Wide Web itself. Intelligent systems can be used at
                    different stages of creation, identification, preservation, authentication, and reolieval of
                    these digital assets.

                <!-- <p> Natural Language Processing is among the hottest topic in the field of data science. Because just in a few years’ time span, natural language processing has evolved into something so powerful and impactful, which no one could have imagined. To understand the power of natural language processing and its impact on our lives, we need to take a look at its applications. Therefore, I have put together a list of some applications of natural language processing.

                <!-- <p> Sanskrit is the oldest Know language to man kind that has such great grammar. Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī grammar has all the features of a modern general-purpose high-level programming language such as C++ or Python. 
                    This includes object-oriented concepts of classes, parent/child inheritance or base/derived classes, overriding of inherited methods 
                    in derived classes, concept of functions, concept of keywords, etc. Of course, algorithmic derivation of results is a given.
                    **There are nearly 14 universities in Germany(Engineering hub of the world) teaching Sanskrit.Where as there are only 18 universities in India.
